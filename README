To run program, type python3 main.py
To interrupt, type Ctrl+C

Pressure ports are defined from 0 to 7 in config file
Change ShowGraphs to "True" if you want to display graphs live or to "False" if you want only logging
RefreshTime is the float that specifies how much times per second ned data is displayed on the graph. It do not affect logging rate
EntriesToDisplay shows how much data points are displayed on the graph



Need to figure out which hardware port has which ID!!!

Exactly 8 polynomes are required in config to convert voltage to pressure
Polynomes have a formula [a,b], where (pressure = a*voltage + b) formula is used to convert raw output to pressure in kpa

Matplotlib required

Drivers for Sequent Microsystems RTD board required:

     

    ~$ git clone https://github.com/SequentMicrosystems/rtd-rpi.git
    ~$ cd /home/pi/rtd-rpi
    ~/rtd-rpi$ sudo make install
    ~/rtd-rpi$ rtd
